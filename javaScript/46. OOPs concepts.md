# 🏛 The 4 Main Pillars of OOP

1. Encapsulation
    
2. Abstraction
    
3. Inheritance
    
4. Polymorphism
    

Let’s go one by one — with JS examples.

---

# 1️⃣ Encapsulation

### Definition

Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a unit (object/class), and restricting direct access to some parts.

### In JavaScript

```js
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0;   // private field

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const acc = new BankAccount();
acc.deposit(100);
console.log(acc.getBalance()); // 100
```

- `#balance` is private.
    
- You cannot access it directly.
    
- Data is protected inside the object.
    

Without classes (using closures):

```js
function BankAccount() {
  let balance = 0;

  return {
    deposit(amount) {
      balance += amount;
    },
    getBalance() {
      return balance;
    }
  };
}
```

Same idea.

---

# 2️⃣ Abstraction

### Definition

Hiding complex internal implementation and exposing only necessary parts.

Example:

When you use:

```js
fetch("https://api.com")
```

You don’t know:

- TCP handshake
    
- HTTP protocol
    
- DNS resolution
    

That complexity is abstracted away.

In JS class:

```js
class Car {
  start() {
    this.#injectFuel();
    this.#igniteEngine();
  }

  #injectFuel() {}
  #igniteEngine() {}
}
```

User calls:

```js
car.start();
```

They don’t see the internal steps.

---

# 3️⃣ Inheritance

You already mastered this 😄

### Definition

One object/class acquires properties and behavior from another.

In JavaScript (prototypal):

```js
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof");
  }
}

const d = new Dog();
d.speak(); // inherited
d.bark();
```

Under the hood:

```
Dog.prototype → Animal.prototype → Object.prototype
```

This is delegation via prototype chain.

---

# 4️⃣ Polymorphism

### Definition

Same method name, different behavior depending on object.

```js
class Shape {
  area() {}
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  area() {
    return 3.14 * 10 * 10;
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  area() {
    return 10 * 10;
  }
}
```

Both have `area()`, but behavior differs.

JS also supports dynamic polymorphism naturally:

```js
function makeSound(animal) {
  animal.speak();
}
```

As long as object has `speak()`, it works.

This is called **duck typing**.

# 🧠 Extra 2 Concepts Often Added

Some people expand to 6 pillars by adding:

5️⃣ Composition  
6️⃣ Association / Message Passing

---

# 5️⃣ Composition (Prefer over Inheritance)

Instead of inheriting, combine objects.

```js
const canFly = {
  fly() { console.log("Flying"); }
};

const bird = {
  ...canFly
};

bird.fly();
```

Better than deep inheritance trees.

---

# 6️⃣ Association / Message Passing

Objects communicate by calling methods on each other.

```js
class Order {
  constructor(paymentService) {
    this.paymentService = paymentService;
  }

  checkout() {
    this.paymentService.pay();
  }
}
```

Objects interact via method calls.

---

# 🔥 Important: OOP in JavaScript is Different

JS is NOT classical OOP like Java or C++.

It is:

> Prototype-based OOP

Classes in JS are just syntax sugar over prototypes.

```js
class Hero {}
```

Becomes internally:

```js
function Hero() {}
Hero.prototype = { constructor: Hero }
```

So:

Inheritance in JS = prototype delegation.

# 📌 Summary Table

|Pillar|Meaning|JS Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|Encapsulation|Hide data|Closures, private fields|
|Abstraction|Hide complexity|Expose methods only|
|Inheritance|Reuse behavior|Prototype chain|
|Polymorphism|Same interface, different behavior|Method overriding|
|Composition|Combine behaviors|Object merging|
|Association|Objects interact|Method calls|

# 🎯 Interview Tip

If asked:

“What are OOP pillars in JS?”

Say:

> JavaScript supports OOP principles like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. However, unlike classical languages, JavaScript implements inheritance through prototypes rather than traditional class-based inheritance.

That answer shows maturity.
