in Console(browser)

```js
const newHero = ["hulk", "spiderman"]
```

When you expand it in DevTools you see:

```
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)
```

and a bunch of methods like `map`, `filter`, `find`, etc.

Let’s slow down and truly understand this.

# 1️⃣ “Everything is object” — not exactly

In JavaScript:

- Objects ✅
    
- Arrays ✅
    
- Functions ✅
    
- Dates ✅
    
- Regex ✅
    

But primitives are NOT objects:

- number
    
- string
    
- boolean
    
- null
    
- undefined
    
- symbol
    
- bigint
    

However…

JS temporarily wraps primitives in objects when needed.

Example:

```js
"hello".toUpperCase()
```

That works because JS temporarily creates a `String` object.

---

# 2️⃣ What REALLY is an array?

This:

```js
const newHero = ["hulk", "spiderman"]
```

Is actually:

```js
const newHero = new Array("hulk", "spiderman")
```

And `Array` is a built-in constructor function.

Specifically the global ECMAScript specification defines how `Array` works.

---

# 3️⃣ What DevTools is Showing You

When you see:

```
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)
```

It means:

```
newHero.__proto__ === Array.prototype
```

So your array’s prototype is:

```js
Array.prototype
```

And THAT object contains:

- map
    
- filter
    
- find
    
- concat
    
- etc.
    

---

# 4️⃣ The Real Prototype Chain

Here is what actually exists:

```
newHero
   ↓
Array.prototype
   ↓
Object.prototype
   ↓
null
```

Now it becomes powerful.

---

## Step A — Your Array

```js
newHero
```

Contains:

```
{
  0: "hulk",
  1: "spiderman",
  length: 2
}
```

Just a normal object with special behavior.

---

## Step B — Array.prototype

This contains shared methods:

```
{
  map: function,
  filter: function,
  find: function,
  push: function,
  ...
}
```

When you call:

```js
newHero.map()
```

JS does:

1. Look inside `newHero` → no `map`
    
2. Go to `__proto__`
    
3. Finds it inside `Array.prototype`
    
4. Executes it
    

---

## Step C — Object.prototype

After `Array.prototype`, the chain continues:

```js
Object.prototype
```

This contains:

- toString
    
- hasOwnProperty
    
- valueOf
    

That’s why arrays also have:

```js
newHero.hasOwnProperty("0")
```

Even though you didn’t define it.

---

# 5️⃣ Why Arrays Are “Special Objects”

Arrays are objects with:

- Numeric keys
    
- Automatic `length` tracking
    
- Special internal behavior for indexes
    

But they are still objects:

```js
typeof newHero  // "object"
```

---

# 6️⃣ Let’s Prove It

Try this:

```js
console.log(Array.prototype === newHero.__proto__) // true
console.log(Object.prototype === Array.prototype.__proto__) // true
```

Mind blown moment 🤯

---

# 7️⃣ Functions Are Objects Too

```js
function test() {}
```

Prototype chain:

```
test
   ↓
Function.prototype
   ↓
Object.prototype
   ↓
null
```

Even functions are objects.

---

# 8️⃣ The Big Truth

JavaScript is basically:

> A giant chain of objects linked together.

Everything (except primitives) is:

- An object
    
- Linked to another object
    
- Until it reaches `null`
    

---

# 9️⃣ Why This Feels Hard

Because JS has:

- Objects
    
- Functions (that are objects)
    
- Constructors (that are functions)
    
- prototype
    
- **proto**
    
- Built-in constructors like `Array`, `Object`, `Function`
    

It’s a web of linked objects.

But the core idea is SIMPLE:

> Objects inherit behavior from other objects using prototype chains.

---

# 🔥 Final Mental Model

Think of it like this:

- Your array = small object
    
- It doesn’t contain methods
    
- It borrows them from `Array.prototype`
    
- That borrows from `Object.prototype`
    

That’s it.
