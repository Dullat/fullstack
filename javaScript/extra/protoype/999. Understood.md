```js
ok hear me out

.prototype is for attaching some new funs to a constructor function

like Hero.prototype.sayHi = some fun
to access this fun we do Hero.prototype

__proto__ is for accessing the where it inherited in chain, from instance.

if i do h1.__proto__ will log the Hero.prototype and this is how we know what is the blueprint(class) of an instance

am i right?
```

# Answer :

You are **very close**. Like 90% correct.  
Let’s sharpen the remaining 10% so it becomes crystal clear.

# ✅ What You Said (Correct Parts)

> `.prototype is for attaching new functions to a constructor function`

✔ YES.

When you do:

```js
Hero.prototype.sayHi = function () {}
```

You are attaching shared methods that all instances will inherit.

---

> `__proto__ is for accessing where it inherited in chain, from instance`

✔ YES.

`__proto__` (better: `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`) shows:

> “From which object am I inheriting behavior?”

---

> `if i do h1.__proto__ will log the Hero.prototype`

✔ YES.

If:

```js
const h1 = new Hero()
```

Then:

```js
h1.__proto__ === Hero.prototype // true
```

Perfect.

# 🔥 Now Let’s Fix the Slight Misunderstanding

You said:

> this is how we know what is the blueprint (class) of an instance

This is _almost_ correct — but here’s the refinement:

👉 `h1.__proto__` tells you which object it delegates to.

That object is usually the constructor’s `.prototype`.

But technically:

- JavaScript doesn’t have real classes internally.
    
- It has **objects linked to objects**.
    

So `Hero.prototype` isn’t a “class”.  
It’s just another object.

# 🧠 The Precise Mental Model

When you do:

```js
function Hero(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

You get:

```js
Hero.prototype = {
  constructor: Hero
}
```

Then:

```js
const h1 = new Hero("hulk")
```

Internally:

```
h1
   ↓
Hero.prototype
   ↓
Object.prototype
   ↓
null
```

So yes:

> `Hero.prototype` becomes the “blueprint object” for instances.

But remember:

It’s just an object.

Not a class.  
Not special.  
Just linked.

# 💡 The Most Important Clarification

### `.prototype` is used when CREATING objects.

### `__proto__` is used when LOOKING UP properties.

Different purposes.

---

# 🧩 Even More Accurate Version of What You Said

Here’s your corrected statement:

> `.prototype` is a property on constructor functions that stores methods to be shared by instances.  
> When we create an instance using `new`, the instance’s `__proto__` is set to that constructor’s `.prototype`.  
> That’s how inheritance works in JavaScript.

That is 100% accurate.

---

# 🎯 One Small Warning

Don’t think:

```
instance.__proto__ === constructor
```

❌ Wrong.

It equals:

```
constructor.prototype
```

That small difference causes big confusion.

# 🧠 Final Test for You

Without running code, answer this:

```js
function A() {}
const a = new A();

console.log(a.__proto__ === A.prototype); // ?
console.log(A.__proto__ === Function.prototype); // ?
console.log(A.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // ?
```

If you can answer all three confidently, you fully understand prototypes.
