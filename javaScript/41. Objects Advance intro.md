## 🧭 The Correct Next Step (in order)

### ✅ **1️⃣ Objects (but not basic “key–value” stuff)**

You already know `{}`. Skip that.

Focus on:

- how objects are **created by functions**
    
- how objects **delegate behavior**
    
- how objects **find properties**
    

This unlocks **everything else**.

---

## What “Objects” actually means at your level

### 🔹 Object creation patterns

- Object literals
    
- Factory functions
    
- Constructor functions
    
- `Object.create`
    

👉 You already touched **2 of these**. We’ll complete the picture.

---

### 🔹 Property lookup & delegation

This answers:

- why prototypes exist
    
- how inheritance _actually_ works
    
- why `this` behaves weird
    

```js
obj.prop
```

JS does:

1. check `obj`
    
2. check `obj.__proto__`
    
3. keep going
    

That’s **object behavior**, not function behavior.

---

### 🔹 Methods & `this`

Objects introduce:

- method calls
    
- dynamic `this`
    
- binding issues
    

This explains:

- why arrow functions break things
    
- why `bind` exists
    

---

### 🔹 Object identity

```js
obj1 === obj2 // false
```

Even if they look the same.

This matters for:

- constructors
    
- prototypes
    
- memory
    

---

## Why NOT jump to classes yet 🚫

Classes:

- hide prototypes
    
- hide delegation
    
- make you _think_ in Java terms
    

If you do **objects first**, classes become:

> “Oh… this is just syntax sugar.”

Which is exactly where you want to be.

---

## 🧠 The learning chain (lock this in)

You’ve already done:

```
Functions
  ↓
Closures
  ↓
Factory functions
  ↓
Constructor functions
```

Next is:

```
Objects
  ↓
Prototype chain
  ↓
this binding
  ↓
Inheritance
  ↓
Classes (optional)
```

This is the **natural slope**, not a jump.

---

## What I’d teach you next (lesson 1 of objects)

If you say _yes_, we’ll start with:

### 👉 **“How JS finds a property (prototype lookup)”**

No `class`, no theory — just:

- real objects
    
- real logs
    
- mental model
    

After that:

- `__proto__` vs `prototype` becomes obvious
    
- inheritance stops being scary
    
- `this` finally makes sense
